Hello! Iâ€™m Lucas, originally from Santos, 38 years old, with a strong passion for technology and innovation. Outside of work and studies, I enjoy playing basketball and cycling, as well as spending time with friends and watching good movies.

Currently, Iâ€™m deepening my knowledge in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at UEL, focusing on development of applications for use whith AI's using languages like Python, R, and object-oriented programming techniques. My goal is to use these tools to solve real-world problems and contribute with efficient, high-impact solutions.

Iâ€™m always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow, learn, and share knowledge. If you're interested in discussing technology, AI, or exploring new ideas, Iâ€™d be happy to connect!

Let's enjoy the journey!!!
